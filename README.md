Inline Editing with ng-table

##The Problem
I was working on web app that needed inline editing in a grid. I wanted to use ng-table to do this but neither did the ng-table documentation mention it supports this nor was I able to find any online samples on it. 

##The Reason
Well I thought how hard could it be. I started looking at the ng-table documentation to understand the API to figure out whether we can do it.

##The Solution
ng-table api supports setting the current data using the supplied "NgTableParams" service. The solution is based around that. I will let the code do the rest of the talking.
